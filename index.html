                How New Media Has Changed How we do Business
            </div>
            <br>
            New media has affected how we do business in several ways. The way we purchase products changed with inventions such as Apple Pay, 
            where you pay by tapping your phone on a scanner. There are also websites like Amazon and eBay where all the payment is done with your credit card. 
            Small businesses also have a much easier time getting started up using advertisements on websites like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. 
            This way, more people see the products you’re selling and can buy them from online shops. A good example of this is the rap industry. 
            Before new media you had to have an already well distinguished rapper produce your songs, but now using apps like SoundCloud so more people 
            can hear and buy your music.The media also makes it much easier to communicate with potential customers about your product and how to buy your product.

                How New Media Has Affected Our Social Habits
            </div>
            <br>
            New media such as phones, TV and other electronic devices have changed our social habits drastically. Youth that have access to new media often stay at home or 
            indoors rather than going outside and meeting their friends or playing sports. This has led to the new generation to be larger or obese. 
            This does have a flip side though, some people are taking advantage of the media by communicating with friends and meeting at a set location 
            or organising rides to a soccer game. Another big change is the apps like Instagram and Snapchat, which  influences the way teens eat and dress 
            trying to meet the impossible standards that the models post online.

                How New Media Has Affected Our Culture
            </div>
            <br>
            Culture can be greatly influenced by new media. The change in culture is greatest in teens and children because their brains are very impressionable, and will make 
            changes to their lives based on what they see online. Whatever it may be, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, you can see the change in the way people speak, dress, do 
            hobbies, deal with different situations, and choices they make. All of this together can lead to an overall loss in culture. A positive impact new media has had 
            on the world is that it is much easier to find people with similar interests and hobbies to your own.

            How New Media Has Affected Our Intelligence
            </div>
            <br>
            With technology and instant access to media and information, it is much easier to to learn new things. Take words for example, If you didn’t know what a word meant 
            before smartphones and computers, you had to look it up in a dictionary. Now you type in the word on google and get the dictionary definition, It makes getting new 
            information much easier and faster than before. It’s not all good though because people are becoming more reliant on their smartphones to solve questions. Even if 
            they know how to solve the question they often don't try to figure it out, they just search up the answer on their phones.
